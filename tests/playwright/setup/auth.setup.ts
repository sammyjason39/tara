/**
 * Playwright `setup` project (Verification_Suite, Phase 16, task 16.2).
 *
 * Replaces the previous hardcoded-demo-credentials login. For the phase under verification this
 * project provisions a FRESH Synthetic_Organization on the Live_Environment by driving the real
 * self-service sign-up + onboarding flow (`provisionSyntheticOrg`, task 16.1), then persists the
 * resulting per-run Playwright storage state so the dependent spec projects authenticate as that
 * synthetic owner.
 *
 * Design references:
 *   .kiro/specs/frontend-stabilization/design.md → "Playwright project setup"
 *   Requirements 11.4 (provision a fresh Synthetic_Organization per phase),
 *                11.8 (data isolated to the synthetic tenant; records identifiable/cleanable).
 *
 * SECRETS HANDLING: no credentials are embedded here. `provisionSyntheticOrg` resolves the live
 * URLs by key name from env / `vps_reference.md` and generates the per-run owner password, so this
 * file never contains secret values. The only thing written to disk is the per-run storage state
 * (gitignored under `tests/playwright/.auth/`).
 *
 * STORAGE-STATE STRATEGY: `provisionSyntheticOrg` writes the per-run state to
 * `tests/playwright/.auth/<runId>.json` (kept for traceability). This setup also copies that state
 * to the canonical `tests/playwright/.auth/user.json` that the `chromium`/per-phase projects load
 * via `storageState` — the lower-risk option that needs no change to each project's `storageState`
 * path. The full `SyntheticOrg` fixture is written to `tests/playwright/.auth/<phase>.org.json` for
 * the phase specs to consume.
